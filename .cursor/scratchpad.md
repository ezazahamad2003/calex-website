# Waitlist with Supabase Integration

## Background and Motivation

The user wants to connect the existing waitlist system to Supabase database instead of using the current file-based storage system. Currently, the waitlist is stored in a JSON file (`data/waitlist.json`) and has a robust API with validation, duplicate checking, and statistics tracking.

**Current System Analysis:**
- ✅ API endpoint at `/api/waitlist` with POST, GET, DELETE methods
- ✅ Zod validation for founder and lawyer schemas
- ✅ Duplicate email checking
- ✅ Statistics tracking (total, founders, lawyers)
- ✅ File-based storage with proper error handling
- ✅ Admin functionality for removing entries

**Migration Goals:**
- Replace file-based storage with Supabase database
- Maintain all existing functionality
- Add proper environment variable management
- Ensure data integrity during migration
- Keep the same API interface for frontend compatibility

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. **Database Schema Design**: Need to create appropriate tables in Supabase that match the current data structure
2. **Environment Setup**: Configure Supabase client and environment variables
3. **Data Migration**: Plan for migrating existing data from JSON to database
4. **Error Handling**: Ensure robust error handling for database operations
5. **Security**: Implement proper RLS (Row Level Security) policies in Supabase
6. **Dependencies**: Add Supabase client to the project

## High-level Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Supabase Setup and Configuration
- [ ] Install Supabase client dependency
- [ ] Set up environment variables for Supabase connection
- [ ] Create Supabase project and get credentials
- [ ] Test database connection

### Phase 2: Database Schema Creation
- [ ] Design database schema for waitlist entries
- [ ] Create tables in Supabase dashboard
- [ ] Set up Row Level Security policies
- [ ] Create indexes for performance

### Phase 3: Code Migration
- [ ] Create Supabase client configuration
- [ ] Update API route to use Supabase instead of file system
- [ ] Implement database CRUD operations
- [ ] Add proper error handling for database operations

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation
- [ ] Test all API endpoints with Supabase
- [ ] Verify data integrity and validation
- [ ] Test duplicate email checking
- [ ] Verify statistics calculation
- [ ] Test admin functionality

### Phase 5: Data Migration (if needed)
- [ ] Create migration script for existing data
- [ ] Backup existing data
- [ ] Migrate data from JSON to Supabase
- [ ] Verify migration success

## Project Status Board
